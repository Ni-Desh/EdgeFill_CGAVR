# EdgeFill_CGAVR
This C++ OpenGL program implements the Edge Fill Algorithm to fill user-defined polygons using scan-line filling. Left mouse clicks add vertices, a right click finalizes the polygon, and another left click fills it with yellow. Ideal for learning polygon filling techniques in computer graphics.
